# Energy-Spectra-of-WSCP-molecule
The goal is to write numeric simulations of water-soluble-chlorophyll-binding-protein(WSCP) energy spectra. I will use Matlab and Python. At now it is only the beginnig of code. I will write the code to draw a two dimensional spectra of two, three and 4 excited states of WSCP. The molecule WSCP can be descibed by Frenkel excitons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exciton We get hamiltonian matrix from Frenkel exciton hamiltonian:

Dipole matrix we got from dipole potencial:
